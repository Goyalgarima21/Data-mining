DOHMH New York City Restaurant Inspection 
I was interested in the DOHMH New York City Restaurant Inspection Results dataset 
because it has a wealth of information it provides about the restaurant industry in 
New York City. It contains data on more than 200,000 restaurant inspections 
conducted over more than 10 years, providing insights into the health and safety of 
the city's food service establishments.
But I have analyzed that the dataset has many rows and columns. To achieve the best 
results, let's narrow down the dataset to only include the year "2021" (just after the 
end of the COVID pandemic) and analyze how many restaurant violations are still 
critical in New York.
After filtering the data frame to keep only 
records for 2021, I have taken the required columns which are the violation 
description and critical flag. Also, designed a model which can predict whether any 
kind of violation is critical or not within the system.
Future work-1. As my notebook stated, I get 8 false negatives and 6 false positives, so 
there are a few type I and type II errors, which are mistaken rejections and false 
alarms. The error rate is low, but I will try to learn how to solve overestimation and 
underestimation errors and work on them. (In the summer break)
2. I will try to analyze the association between the location of the restaurant and the 
types of violations that are most commonly observed in that area.
3. Majorly, I will better understand the factors that contribute to the health and safety 
of food service establishments in New York (this will surely take time, but I will try to 
build the relationships and potential factors influencing health and safety)
